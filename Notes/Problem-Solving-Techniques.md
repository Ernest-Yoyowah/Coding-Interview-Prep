## Problem Solving Techniques

### Pseudocode and Problem Analysis

When approaching coding challenges, I follow a systematic problem-solving process that involves breaking down the problem, analyzing its requirements, and designing a solution. Here's a brief overview of my approach:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** I start by carefully reading and understanding the problem statement. I identify the input, output, constraints, and any edge cases.

2. **Breaking Down the Problem:** I break the problem into smaller subproblems or components. This helps me focus on solving individual parts before tackling the whole problem.

3. **Pseudocode:** Before writing actual code, I often create pseudocode to outline the logic and steps of my solution. This helps me clarify my thoughts and plan the implementation.

4. **Algorithm Design:** Based on the pseudocode, I design the algorithm that will solve the problem. I choose appropriate data structures and algorithms to optimize time and space complexity.

### Example Problem Analysis

Let's take a recent coding challenge as an example:

**Problem:** LeetCode Problem XYZ
**Description:** Given an array of integers, find two numbers that add up to a specific target sum.

**Solution Approach:**

1. Create a hash map to store seen elements.
2. Iterate through the array:
   - Calculate the complement (target - current element).
   - Check if the complement exists in the hash map.
   - If yes, return the indices of the two elements.
   - If not, add the current element to the hash map.
3. If no solution is found, return an appropriate response

## Time Complexity Analysis

Understanding the time complexity of an algorithm helps in evaluating its efficiency.

- **Big O Notation:** A way to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's running time in the worst-case scenario.

### Common Time Complexities:

- O(1) - Constant Time: Operations that take the same amount of time regardless of the input size.
- O(log n) - Logarithmic Time: Common in algorithms that repeatedly cut the problem size in half.
- O(n) - Linear Time: Time increases linearly with input size.
- O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time: Often seen in efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort and heap sort.
- O(n^2) - Quadratic Time: Nested loops that iterate over the input.
- O(2^n) - Exponential Time: Usually seen in recursive algorithms that solve a problem of size n by recursively solving two smaller problems of size n-1.
- O(n!) - Factorial Time: Extremely slow-growing time complexity.

## Problem Solving Techniques

### Sliding Window Technique

The sliding window technique involves creating a window of elements within an array or string and sliding it over the data to solve problems.

### Two Pointers Technique

The two pointers technique involves maintaining two pointers in an array and manipulating them to solve problems efficiently.
