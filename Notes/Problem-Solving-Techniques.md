# Problem Solving Techniques

## Time Complexity Analysis

Understanding the time complexity of an algorithm helps in evaluating its efficiency.

- **Big O Notation:** A way to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's running time in the worst-case scenario.

### Common Time Complexities:

- O(1) - Constant Time: Operations that take the same amount of time regardless of the input size.
- O(log n) - Logarithmic Time: Common in algorithms that repeatedly cut the problem size in half.
- O(n) - Linear Time: Time increases linearly with input size.
- O(n log n) - Linearithmic Time: Often seen in efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort and heap sort.
- O(n^2) - Quadratic Time: Nested loops that iterate over the input.
- O(2^n) - Exponential Time: Usually seen in recursive algorithms that solve a problem of size n by recursively solving two smaller problems of size n-1.
- O(n!) - Factorial Time: Extremely slow-growing time complexity.

## Problem Solving Techniques

### Sliding Window Technique

The sliding window technique involves creating a window of elements within an array or string and sliding it over the data to solve problems.

### Two Pointers Technique

The two pointers technique involves maintaining two pointers in an array and manipulating them to solve problems efficiently.
