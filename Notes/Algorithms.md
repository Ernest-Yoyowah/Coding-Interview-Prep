## Sorting Algorithms

### Bubble Sort

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they're in the wrong order.

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Worst Case: O(n^2)
  - Best Case (with optimization): O(n)
  - Average Case: O(n^2)

## Searching Algorithms

### Binary Search

Binary search is a fast search algorithm that works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Worst Case: O(log n)
  - Best Case: O(1) (when the middle element is the desired element)
  - Average Case: O(log n)
